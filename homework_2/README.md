## Description: 
Problem #4: To understand the value of counting loops, write a program that implements matrix multiplication using counting loop constructs. Then write the same program using only logical loopsâ€”for example, while loops. Use Java or C/C++. The matrices should be declared as double-dimensional arrays ([][]) and could be either float or int. You should also include a script that tests your code.

## Info
My Homework 2 file will have the code accompanied by a pdf of problems 1 - 3 (Non- programming excercises as well as I will submit two files the HW#2 file and a pdf only of the first 3 problems to sastify the instructions.)

## How to run : 
add later..
