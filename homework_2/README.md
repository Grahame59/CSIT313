# Matrix Multiplication Program

## Description: 
Problem #4: To understand the value of counting loops, write a program that implements matrix multiplication using counting loop constructs. Then write the same program using only logical loopsâ€”for example, while loops. Use Java or C/C++. The matrices should be declared as double-dimensional arrays ([][]) and could be either float or int. You should also include a script that tests your code.

## Info
- My Homework 2 file will have the code accompanied by a pdf of problems 1 - 3 (Non- programming excercises as well as I will submit two files the HW#2 file and a pdf only of the first 3 problems to sastify the instructions).
- There is a PNG called ConsoleOutputForHw2(CSIT313) in the hoemwork_2 folder. This is my final test case and I believe this is the script of output you wanted in the instructions.
- Also I used jagged arrays (as the instructions asked) but a 2D array ['',''] would've been efficient for this I believe, the jagged arrays make it overly complex because they can have different columns per row.

## How to run : 
1. Open Docker environment.
2. Naviagte to Hw#2 : cd homework_2\Program.cs
3. Compile/Run the code: 
    - dotnet build
    - dotnet run
4. Follow the console queries and enter the ints related to the prompts.
5. Look at your beautiful Matrix multiplication result !
